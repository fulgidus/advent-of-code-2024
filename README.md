This repository contains my solutions for the Code Advent Calendar 2024 challenges. It serves as a personal record of my progress and solutions

## 📖 About

The Code Advent Calendar is a series of daily programming challenges that take place in December. Each day, a new challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their preferred programming language.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to save my results and track my progress throughout the event. However, I believe it can also be helpful for others who might get stuck on a particular challenge. Feel free to browse through my solutions if you need some inspiration or guidance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I highly recommend attempting to solve the challenges on your own before referring to any solutions. The learning experience is much more valuable when you work through the problems independently.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge having its own Python file and corresponding input file. For example:

```
day1.py
day1.txt
day2.py
day2.txt
...
```

## 🚀 Usage

To run a specific day's solution, simply execute the corresponding Python file. For example, to run the solution for day 1:

```sh
python day1.py
```
