# 📅 Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. It serves as a personal record of my progress and solutions

You can read more about it [here](https://fulgidus.github.io/posts/advent-2024/)

## 📖 About

The Advent of Code is a series of daily programming challenges that take place in December. Each day, a new challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their preferred programming language.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to save my results and track my progress throughout the event. However, I believe it can also be helpful for others who might get stuck on a particular challenge. Feel free to browse through my solutions if you need some inspiration or guidance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I highly recommend attempting to solve the challenges on your own before referring to any solutions. The learning experience is much more valuable when you work through the problems independently.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge having its own Python file and corresponding input file. For example:

```
all_test.py

day1_test.py
day1.py
day1.txt

day2_test.py
day2.py
day2.txt

...
```

## 🚀 Usage

To run a specific day's solution, simply execute the corresponding Python file. For example, to run the solution for day 1:

```sh
python3 day1.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Per eseguire i test, utilizza il modulo `unittest` di Python. Puoi eseguire tutti i test con il seguente comando:
```sh
python3 -m unittest all_test.py
```
Oppure puoi eseguire un singolo file di test specifico:

```sh
python3 -m unittest day1_test.py
```
